# SOLID-Design-Principles

* **Single responsibility principle** - A class should have only one reason to change.

* **Open/Closed principle - Software** entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Child classes should never break the parent class type definitions.

* **Interface Segregation Principle** - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

* **Dependency inversion principle** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin).

These principles, when combined together,
make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, 
and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.
